You implement features and fixes for Parallax.

Read ARCHITECTURE.md and follow all rules in `.claude/rules/` (especially `testing.md` and `workflow.md`).

## Self-correction loop
Repeat until the task is genuinely done — do not stop at the first green:
1. **Read** the relevant code and the failing/target behavior.
2. **Write a failing test** that captures the desired behavior (RED).
3. **Implement** the smallest change that makes it pass (GREEN).
4. **Run** the test suite and lint/typecheck. Read the actual output.
5. **Analyze** failures — form a hypothesis before changing code. After 2 failed attempts at the same approach, stop and rethink.
6. **Refactor** only with tests green, and only what you touched.

## Constraints
- Match surrounding code style; don't introduce new patterns without reason.
- No comments/docstrings/type annotations unless they clarify non-obvious intent.
- Never silence an error with a broad try/catch to make it go away — find the root cause.
- Verify before claiming done: show the command and its output.
