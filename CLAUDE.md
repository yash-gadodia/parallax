# Parallax

A Gen Z **couples app** (React Native + Expo): a daily "drop" of 3 prompts where each partner answers for themselves and places a *hunch* on the other; a server-gated reveal scores their "wavelength." Refocus (AI conflict mediation) + a shared Love Map feed the same loop. Design source of truth: `design_handoff_parallax/`.

Read ARCHITECTURE.md before planning or structural changes. Claude auto-follows clarify → plan → implement → test → self-review, scaled to task size (you don't need to type `/plan` or `/test`).

## Commands
- **Install**: `npm install` (use `--legacy-peer-deps` if it errors — reanimated/worklets peer range)
- **Dev**: `npx expo start` (press `i` iOS sim, `a` Android) · **Bundle check**: `npx expo export -p ios`
- **Test**: `npm test` (jest) · **Watch**: `npm run test:watch` · **Typecheck**: `npm run typecheck`
- **Local backend**: `supabase start` → `supabase db reset` (applies migrations + seed) · **DB tests**: `supabase test db` (pgTAP)

## Stack
- **App**: Expo SDK 56, React Native 0.85, React 19, TypeScript, **Expo Router** (file-based, `app/`)
- **Backend**: **Supabase** (Postgres + Auth + Realtime); RLS is the privacy backbone + reveal gate
- **State**: Zustand (UI/local) + @tanstack/react-query + supabase-js; **Reanimated 4**, react-native-svg, expo-blur, MaskedView
- **Tests**: jest + jest-expo + @testing-library/react-native; pgTAP for SQL/RLS

## React Native fidelity (hard-won — see `.claude/rules/frontend.md`)
- `lineHeight` is **pixels**, never a CSS multiplier (`lineHeight: fontSize*1.4`, NOT `1.5`).
- Every `<Text>` needs its **own explicit `color`** — RN does not inherit color from parent Views.
- **Reuse the atoms** in `src/components` (Btn, Wordmark, Peek, Ring, GradientText, TabBar, Sheet…). Don't reimplement.
- Tokens from `src/design/tokens` + `typography`. Gradient text → `GradientText`; blur → expo-blur; icons → `Icon`.

## Supabase (see `.claude/rules/database.md`)
- All cross-partner writes go through SECURITY DEFINER Postgres functions; never trust the client. Reveal gate enforced in RLS (pgTAP-proven).
- supabase-js typed `.rpc()`/`.update()` sometimes infers `never` — use a documented `// @ts-expect-error` (the codebase pattern), never `as any`.

## Conventions
- TypeScript everywhere; **no `any` / `@ts-ignore`** in source (one documented `@ts-expect-error` for the supabase quirk is OK).
- Keep it simple; match surrounding code; don't refactor unrelated code while fixing a bug; no comments unless they clarify non-obvious intent.

## Testing & Git
- Co-located `*.test.ts(x)`. Assert exact values (not ranges/truthiness). Tests must actually `render()` + assert — never `expect(<JSX/>).toBeTruthy()`. jest mocks live in `jest-setup.ts` (reanimated, safe-area, expo-router, supabase, AsyncStorage).
- Conventional Commits; small focused commits; only commit when asked.

## Workflow / Do NOT
- After 2 failed attempts, stop and rethink. **Verify before claiming done** (run it, show output) — `npm test` + `npm run typecheck` + `npx expo export`. Delegate verbose runs to subagents.
- Don't commit secrets (a hook blocks `.env`/keys). Don't `npm install` stray deps in fixes. Don't leave `ios/`/`android/` or `.env` uncommitted-but-tracked (gitignored).
